1. text reveal - no effect at all
2. code comparison - behaviour not sync, after code should remove blur on hover, color not obvious in night theme
3. scroll progress - not following my scroll progress, expected will move along with my scroll bar
4. hero parallax - a lot content below is missing, suppose the items will move and behave different across scrolling
